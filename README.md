sql2json
========

A simple tool written in Go, that takes a SQL dump and outputs JSON.

### Example
`sql2json mydb.sql > mydb.json`

### Notes
- Only tested on a few MySQL dumps, so it may blow up in your face, but give it a try and let me know where it failed.
- Written in a hurry, so it might not be the most beautful code in the world.
